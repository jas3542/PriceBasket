# PriceBasket
 Buy grocery. Items include oranges,bread,milk and beans

# Todo:
- See if exceptions are needed (errors are being logged)
- Move discounts feature to a different service. (Discount service)
- The list of items should be populated by a json file.(easier for the admins to add new products to the system).
- discounts also should be in a json file.(easier for the admins to add new discounts to the system).

# Bugs:
- Offers are not adding the currency symbol (p for pennys and Â£ for pounds).
